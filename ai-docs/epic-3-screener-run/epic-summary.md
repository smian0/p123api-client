# Epic-3-screener-run: Implement P123 Screener Run API Integration

## Status
Completed

## Overview
This epic covers the implementation of the P123 Screener Run API integration into the p123api_client library. The Screener Run API allows users to execute screener queries against the P123 platform and retrieve the matching securities with their attributes.

## Business Value
Implementing the Screener Run API functionality will allow users to:
- Execute predefined or custom screeners programmatically
- Filter securities based on complex criteria
- Retrieve screener results in a structured format
- Integrate screener functionality into automated workflows
- Build custom analytics based on screener results

## Technical Approach

### API Integration
The implementation follows the existing pattern of the client library, adding methods to execute screener runs and process the results. The API endpoint for the screener run is:

- **Endpoint**: `/screen/run`
- **Method**: POST
- **Parameters**:
  - `vendor`: Data vendor (optional)
  - `pitMethod`: Point-in-time method (optional)
  - `precision`: Result precision (optional)
  - `screen`: Screen definition parameters (required)
  - `asOfDt`: As of date (optional, defaults to today)
  - `endDt`: End date (optional)

### Response Structure
The API response includes:
- `columns`: Array of column names
- `rows`: Array of row data containing the screener results
- `cost`: API call cost
- `quotaRemaining`: Remaining quota

### Key Components
1. Screener definition interface
2. Request parameter validation
3. API call execution
4. Response parsing and transformation
5. Pandas DataFrame conversion
6. Error handling and debugging
7. VCR-based test recording for reliable testing

## User Stories
- Story-1: Implement basic screener run functionality ✓
- Story-2: Add support for screen definition parameters ✓
- Story-3: Implement results conversion to pandas DataFrame ✓
- Story-4: Add historical screener run support with date parameters ✓
- Story-5: Create comprehensive documentation and examples ✓

## Dependencies
- Existing authentication mechanism
- Base API client infrastructure
- Pandas integration components

## Technical Risks
- API rate limiting considerations
- Complex screen definition validation
- Handling large result sets efficiently

## Success Criteria
- All screener run API parameters are supported ✓
- Results are properly converted to pandas DataFrames ✓
- Error handling is robust and informative ✓
- Documentation includes clear examples ✓
- Test coverage ensures reliability ✓

## Implementation Highlights
- Created a flexible ScreenRunAPI class with both simple and advanced interfaces
- Implemented comprehensive test suite with VCR cassette recording
- Added proper error handling for API-specific error formats
- Created detailed examples for common use cases
- Ensured sensitive data is masked in test recordings
