# Product Requirements Document (PRD) for P123 API Client

## Status: Draft

## Introduction

The P123 API Client is a Python library designed to provide seamless integration with the Portfolio123 (P123) API. Portfolio123 is a platform for stock screening, ranking, and backtesting, and this client library enables programmatic access to these features, allowing researchers, analysts, and quants to incorporate P123 functionality into their automated workflows and custom applications.

The client library abstracts the complexity of API authentication, request formation, and response handling, providing a clean interface for Python developers to interact with P123 services. It includes specialized modules for different P123 API endpoints and provides convenient utilities for common operations.

## Goals

- Provide a comprehensive Python interface to all P123 API endpoints
- Simplify authentication and session management
- Enable seamless data retrieval and manipulation
- Support pandas integration for data analysis workflows
- Ensure robust error handling and informative debugging
- Maintain compatibility with Python 3.10+ environments
- Provide comprehensive documentation and examples

## Features and Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- Secure API authentication with key and secret
- Comprehensive endpoint coverage for P123 API
- Data conversion to pandas DataFrames
- Support for all P123 screening capabilities
- Backtesting integration for strategy evaluation
- Ranking system implementation and testing
- Error handling with informative messages
- Logging for debugging and audit purposes

### Non-functional Requirements

- Type hints for improved IDE integration
- Comprehensive test coverage with VCR for reproducibility
- Detailed documentation with examples
- Consistent API design across modules
- Performance optimization for large data requests
- Thorough input validation to prevent API errors
- Proper masking of sensitive data in logs
