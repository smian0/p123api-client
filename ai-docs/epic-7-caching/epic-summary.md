# Epic-7-caching: Implement P123 API Result Caching System

## Status
Draft

## Overview
This epic covers the implementation of a caching system for the P123 API client to optimize API quota usage. Since P123 data only updates once per day (by 3 AM Eastern Standard Time), there's an opportunity to cache API responses and reuse them until the next data refresh cycle, thereby preserving the limited API quota.

## Business Value
Implementing an effective caching system will provide the following benefits:
- Significantly reduce API quota consumption by eliminating redundant calls
- Improve application performance with faster response times
- Enable offline operation for previously cached queries
- Extend the usability of the API within quota constraints
- Support higher volume of analyses without hitting rate limits
- Provide consistent behavior for repeated analyses

## Technical Approach

### Caching Strategy
The implementation will use a refresh-time-based caching approach with the following characteristics:
- Cache keys based on the exact API call parameters (normalized and serialized)
- Invalidation based on P123's data refresh schedule (3 AM Eastern Standard Time)
- All cache entries expire when P123 updates its data
- Optional manual cache invalidation for immediate refresh
- Persistent storage using SQLite database
- Efficient indexing and query capabilities through SQL
- Minimal overhead for cache lookup
- Transparent integration with existing client methods

### Key Components
1. Cache key generation from API parameters
2. SQLite-based storage backend for cached responses
3. Time-based cache invalidation
4. Cache hit/miss tracking
5. Optional cache bypass for force-refresh
6. SQL query optimization for efficient lookups
7. Cache statistics and monitoring

## User Stories

**Consolidated Implementation Approach**
We've decided to implement the caching system as a single comprehensive story that addresses all aspects in one cohesive solution:

- Story-1-Combined: Implement Complete SQLite-based API Caching System
- Story-2-Screen-Integration: Integrate Caching with Screen Run API

This consolidated approach allows for better integration between components, ensures a cohesive implementation, and simplifies the development process.

## Dependencies
- Existing API client infrastructure
- Time zone handling for proper invalidation
- SQLite database for persistent caching
- Serialization of complex API parameters

## Technical Risks
- Memory consumption with large cached responses
- Potential for stale data if invalidation fails
- Serialization of complex parameter objects
- Cache key collisions
- SQLite database locking in multi-threaded scenarios
- Database size growth over time

## Success Criteria
- API calls with identical parameters return cached results (when data should be unchanged)
- Cache invalidation occurs reliably after data refresh time
- Significant measurable reduction in API quota usage
- Minimal overhead for cached responses
- Complete test coverage for cache operations
- Cache persistence across application restarts
- Efficient SQLite query performance for frequent cache lookups
